\section{Electron Bernstein Waves}
Electron Bernstein waves are electrostatic waves propagating across the magnetic field in a $\textit{hot}$ plasma. They are sustained by electron cyclotron motion and can be thought of as fronts of electron rarefraction and compression perpendicular to the magnetic field. They therefore have wavelength of order of the electron Larmor radius $\rho$:
\begin{equation}
	\lambda \sim \rho
\end{equation}
We clearly need to consider a finite $\rho$ which implies a finite temperature. In a cold plasma electrons are tight to the field lines and only allow space charge waves along the field lines (plasma oscillations).

If we have $\rho \sim \lambda$ and $\omega \sim \omega_{ce}$
